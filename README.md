# Group Ironman Start

There is an overwhelming number of things to do early on. Being an ironman means you can't simply buy questing supplies, teleports, or energy potions. This means we'll want to be doing a number of things at once.

This guide is **very** detailed, but really it is only 3-4 hours. By the time you are done you should have almost 450_ish_ total level, can weild rune, and will be well setup to start exploring and gaming. Basically we're going to blast past the early game and get to the more fun things.

Credit to [Ultimate Ironman Guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ultimate_Ironman_Guide/Step-by-step_to_Prifddinas). I like the multi-questing stuff.

## Preliminaries

All this shit is good to do before you even log in.

- [ ] Make a new account, your old RS3 account is valid, but you likely already made an Old School Account with it. There is no resetting. So you'll likely be making a new one.
- [ ] Get an authenticator on that account (this ensures you can claim coins in the [stronghold of security](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Stronghold_of_Security)). 
- [ ] Have membership, seriously F2P is really slow, it is a waste of time.
- [ ] I suggest using `runelite`. It can be downloaded from `https://runelite.net` or `https://github.com/runelite/runelite`. **Any other website is a phishing site that will steal your account.** Plugins are crazy totally game changing.
- [ ] Sign in a google account, that'll save your settings so you can switch computers/installations.

If you don't care about nostalgia... In Runelite, go the wrench (in the upper right), then at the bottom right where you see `Plugin Hub` and type in `117 HD (beta)` for the HD-OSRS experience.

## Tutorial Island Gotcha's

- [ ] Make a female character (saves time during recruitment drive)
- [ ] Finish Tutorial Island
- [ ] You'll need to talk to an Ironman Tutor before the final step of Tutorial Island to become a **Group** Ironman. **IF YOU FORGET THIS STEP YOU'LL NEED TO MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT**. 
- [ ] Sync up with the group on [The Node](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Group_Ironman_Blog#The_Node). The whole group will have to be online together to form the group.

### Optional Wilderness Prayer Grind (feel free to skip)

I am mentioning this because this is the ideal time. You got zero combat experience; so pretty much nobody can attack you in the wilderness. **This grind sucks**, it is kind of unnecessary, it'll only save you _like an hour_ in the grand scheme of things, but it'll make future quest combat easier. Now this grind will take 4-5 hours, so feel free to skip it. 

That said, we'll be using safe spots and magic for everything, so this just makes setting up safespots easier.

- [ ] Bank everything.
- [ ] Enter the wilderness
- [ ] If you're using runelite, setup the Aggression Plugin (to see how long you have before monsters become non-aggressive), and the menu entry swapper to change the default option on bones to `use` instead of `bury`.
- [ ] Go to the [Bone yard](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bone_Yard)
- [ ] Dodge Skeletons & pick up big bones
- [ ] You're gonna be world hopping to pick up big bones.
- [ ] Get a full inventory of big bones.
- [ ] Walk (only run from monsters, walking saves run energy) to the to [the chaos hut](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Chaos_Temple_%28hut%29)
- [ ] Offer the bones
- [ ] Repeat this 16-18 times until 43 prayer. **Seriously feel free to skip this**.

Grab your shit out of the bank and continue.
